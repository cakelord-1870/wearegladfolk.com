<p><span>Our wooden toy phone serves two important purposes: open-ended play for imaginative little ones (who want their own phone!), as well as helping toddlers and older children memorize important phone numbers. In this age of digital contacts, safety information like phone numbers are perhaps discussed less than in past generations.

<p><span>Learning at home should seamlessly blend form and function, beauty and practicality. </span>Our handmade wooden shapes board with coordinating wood shape pieces is designed with multiple uses in mind - as a matching activity and puzzle for little hands, shape pieces for geometry practice, tracing, and exploration, and as a beautiful piece of art to be displayed when not in use. Inspired by Montessori-style natural materials and the concept of sandpaper letters, this engraved board allows children to trace their fingers in the grooves of the wood and feel each shape while absorbing the beauty of each form in this crisp, clear, easy-to-read chart. Our design features 18 basic shapes and their corresponding names, and all 18 shapes cut out in contrasting walnut wood pieces, plus an optional add-on stand for display.</p>
<p><span><br>INCLUDES:<br>• Shapes Board<br>• 18 Shape Pieces in a Cotton Bag<br><br>OPTIONAL ADD-ON:<br>• Wooden Display Stand</span><br></p>

<p><span>Board measures 13" wide by 10" tall and over 0.5" thick, large enough to be a lovely heirloom piece in the school room and last through many years of home education and puzzle practice. Maple plywood board contrasts beautifully with the matching walnut shape pieces. Small shape pieces come in a cotton drawstring bag for easy storage. Purchase the board &amp; shapes alone and lean on a shelf or lay flat on a table or lap; purchase the board, shapes, and stand together for an easy way to display at all times, and move around the house as needed for a beautiful and accessible reference while studying or drawing.</span><br><br><span>Please note this is not a traditional puzzle where pieces fit down in a deep groove; it is a matching activity where kids can line up the walnut shapes on the board in the correct spots. The board is then fully functional as an art piece when not "in use" with the shape pieces. Shape pieces are also useful independently for games, tracing, or stamping in dough.</span><br><br><span>Wooden stand measures 10" wide by 2" tall and 3" deep with a perfectly angled groove for holding your board. Purchase other reference board designs in our shop and seamlessly switch out your display as needed!</span><br><br><span>Each item is lovingly designed and crafted by hand in our Ohio studio from locally sourced wood. Sealed with food-grade mineral oil and safe for babies and toddlers to enjoy. Our line of modern learning resources are a lovely addition to a nursery, playroom, or homeschool environment and are sure to be treasured for years to come.</span><br><br><span>Please note that each board &amp; stand is unique and made-to-order; wood tone and grain will vary from piece to piece.</span></p></td>
